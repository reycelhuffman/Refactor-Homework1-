## Refactor Homework

## Description 
Edited web site to make sure all properties can be seen and everything fits in one page. 
I first worked on the header, changed everything to sections,
then placed the nav bar in the proper side.  I also added Alt and comment into the image source and 
combined all benefits into one since there was two other that's the same thing.
Changed header div into header section and combined all three online images in my CSS 
and then moved the footer to the right location.
